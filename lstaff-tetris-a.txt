Tetris Part A 
TCSS 305: Programming Practicum, Winter 2016

Subversion Revision Number: 62

Assignment Overview:
This assignment is designed to encompass all of the concepts we've covered this quarter by creating a working Tetris game complete with graphics - using Swing, Timners and OOP concepts - together with the Observer design pattern to create a multi-layered tetris game with keyboard input.

Technical Impression:
Holy cow. This program has definitley been the biggest one I've put together so far. The TetrisGUI class is absolutely HUGE and probably needs to be broken up, but that is something I can work on during part B of this assignment. I had several issues with this - getting the gameboard to draw correctly; setting layouts for various panels; and of course the dreaded next piece panel. This was also a challenege because it is my first time working with the Observer design pattern and not only having to learn what that is but having to implement it correctly in code was a huge challenge.

I want to list several resources I used during my coding:
- The Oracle Tutorials and Java API in general
- "How to Use JPopUpDialog" Tutorial
- "How to Use BoxLayout" Tutorial
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern

Changes to the starter code:
none

Extra Credit:
none

Unresolved problems in my submission:
My drawNextPiece() method of the NextPiecePanel class can only print out the toString() of the next piece instead of a picture representing it's orientation. My drawing of the Tetris board is also not correct.

Questions:
none
